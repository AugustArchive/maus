        <h2 className="font-sans text-3xl ml-12 mt-2">
          Anna ("Anja") Spiegelman was a sensitive and intelligent women born in a rich family. As shown in the
          description, Anja does die from suicide in May, 1968, while not significate in the Maus books, it still hurted
          Artie and Vladek to the days that they were alive.
        </h2>

        <h2 className="font-sans text-3xl ml-12 mt-2">
          In the first chapter of Maus, we are first introducted to Anja around page 15. She is shown as an elegant
          woman, and Vladek gets interested with her, though, Lucia was Vladek's first girlfriend or wife (don't really
          know, ok?) and he dumped her for Anja and... in my own opinion, I think it was the right decision.
        </h2>

        <h1 className="font-serif text-7xl ml-10 mt-8">During the Holocaust</h1>
        <h2 className="font-sans text-3xl ml-12 mt-4">
          I should probably begin with when the Holocaust was first starting to erupt back in September 1939 with the
          Nazi regime. In the second chapter, it started out as Anja translating communist translations into German,
          which caught the eyes of Anja's family and espicially Vladek, since Vladek was opposed to the communist party.
        </h2>

        <h2 className="font-sans text-3xl ml-12 mt-2">
          There is a common theme when we analyze Anja through out the Maus books, she has depression and anxiety, it
          shines through in the first chapter where Vladek went through Anja's closet and found a bunch of
          anti-depressants. This should be when Richeu was born, Anja and Vladek's first child. Since Anja was having
          really hard depression when Richeu was born, the family took care of Vladek's business while Vladek and Anja
          went to a fancy place to clear her mind. This was also when the Holocaust first broke out since the Nazi
          regime had destroyed the train had stopped in the third chapter.
        </h2>

        <h1 className="font-serif text-7xl ml-10 mt-8">Suicide</h1>
        <h2 className="font-sans text-3xl ml-12 mt-4">
          This will be kept short for the time being, but in Chapter 6, Anja had committed suicide while being
          inprisioned and we can see how it affected Artie once you view the pages of him taking the blame for Anja's
          death.
