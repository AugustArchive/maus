## What is Maus?

**Maus** is a story created by Art Spiegelman about his life during the holocaust with an troubled relationship with his father, and a missing mother parental figure.

This was for a final project that I wanted to do since the options were... let's just say tame! So, I decided to create a website that will exist from May 9th, 2022 to June 19th, 2022.

If you're reading this in-between the dates the website is live, you can visit it at [maus.floof.gay](https://maus.floof.gay)! If not, you can just simply clone the repo, `yarn`, and `yarn build && yarn start`, just that simple!
